Because Travis.ci isn't running Express exactly how it runs on campus, there a few things that have to be manually checked in each release including;

- LDAP related features (including invite process, real name resolution, etc)
- Profile Module Manager related features (adding a bundle to a site, erquesting a bunlde, etc)
- Statistics
- Varnish (caching, cache expiration etc)
