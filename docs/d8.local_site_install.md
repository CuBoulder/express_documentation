#Drupal 8 (express-discovery) install to d8.local:

First, add d8.local DNS record to hosts file.

+ Alter hosts file with the following addition:
	192.168.33.23    d8.local

Second, configure items on d8.local.
+ SSH into osr_web_deploy@d8.local
+ nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhosts.conf
+ Change: DocumentRoot /data/atlas/web/express
  + To: DocumentRoot /data/web/express
+ Save vhosts.conf

The web/ directory doesn't exist at the moment, so we have to create it.
+ cd to /data
+ mkdir web/

Then make sure we can clone our repo into web/.
+ sudo chown -R osr_web_deploy:osr_web_deploy web
+ cd to /

Clone the express-discovery repo (Drupal-8.3.x-dev branch from CUBoulder git account).
+ git clone git@github.com:CuBoulder/express-discovery.git /data/web/express/
+ cd to express/sites/default/

Make sure we can write to the files/ directory during install.

+ chmod a+w files/

Create database utf8mb4 (db connection is the same as express except aim the host to d8.local)

Finally, navigate to d8.local on browser and install, or install via crushâ€”if d8 can do that.
