The security office has provided the following information related to what data can be captured via forms on Web Express:

Here is a link to the CU System Data Classification & Impact:

Since moving to HTTPS the security office has modified what can be collected via forms: 
For the groups who have FERPA data the URL I’ve been referring people is http://www.cu.edu/ois/data-classifications-impact.

The short summary is that the following data elements must be encrypted when stored and are likely not appropriate for WebExpress: 
SSN 
NID 
Financial Aid (except work study) 
loan and bank account numbers 
health information 
disability 
race 
ethnicity 
citizenship 
legal presence 
visas 
religion.  

Otherwise, so long as they are enabling HTTPS and ensuring access control (for example, when collecting form input 
the results shouldn’t be publicly accessible) we can use WebExpress for student data.
