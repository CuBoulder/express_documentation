# Sorting Through Drupal Messages In Kibana Logs

Kibana is a great resource to visualize and filter logging data coming out of Express and Atlas. You can export graphs and share URLs with your teammates to help with bug tickets.

For this document, we will only be talking about messages coming out of Drupal, as the other messages are related to Atlas and its tech stack.

## Kibana Base URL

You can start out at https://osr-prod-log01.int.colorado.edu/app/kibana to view Kibana at its root. For now, click on the "Discover" tab in the right-hand sidebar, if you are not on it already.
